Screencast: http://guillaume.martres.me/dotty-cats.webm


**NOTE** This won't actually work yet on your machine because some PRs need to
be merged. Come back in a few days, meanwhile you can play with the Dotty IDE on
the [dotty-example-project](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project) repo.

See
http://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/usage/ide-support.html and
https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty-example-project for more information.
